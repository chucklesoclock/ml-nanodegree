    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as examplified below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: ** The first supervised learning model that is appropriate for this problem is _Support Vector Machines_, or SVMs. My research turned up uses in finance and [biology](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-10-16), but understandably for the former they are not revealing the details. The latter had Yu et al finding that they were able to detect diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes 83.5% of the time from non-laboratory markers and undiagnosed or pre-diabetes 73.2% of the time with 2 additional markers. Interestingly, another [application of SVMs](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btm026) from the related field of bioinformatics showed >= 85% specificity, sensititivy, and accuracy (most were in the high 90s) of classifying microRNA from a certain loop of RNA called a \"hairpin\". Moving on, SVMs are effective in \"high dimensional spaces\", and is versatile due to the choice in kernel functions. Drawbacks include the ability to label only two classes and the difficulty in intrepreting trained model coefficients. I believe a SVM is a good candidate because it handles high numbers of features well, since after one-hot encoding we have 103 features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second model I will choose is _K-Nearest Neighbors_ or kNN. In industry, kNN has been employed in [predicting stock prices and desired features](https://lra.le.ac.uk/handle/2381/37772) (the link is a doctoral thesis but dollars to donuts this is being used in financial firms). The strengths of this model is that it is non-parametric and doesn't assume an underlying model, so it can fit complex patterns. A weakness is that it has to store all the data points, which at > 40K might be a lot for us. I believe that this model is a good candidate because intuitively, people with similar occupations and backgrounds should make around the same amount of money, so measureing \"likeness\" makes sense here. Furthermore, following the [scikit-learn algorithm cheat sheet](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) led me to believe that this would be an appropriate choice; i.e. we are predicting a category, we have < 100K samples, and we assume that the linear support vector classifier isn't working. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I will choose the ensemble method of _Random Forest_ as it is, according to its Berkley professor inventor, [\"unexcelled in accuracy among current algorithms\"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#features). While this could be chalked up to fluff by the creator, the opinion is shared by [Google machine learning practioners](http://blog.echen.me/2011/04/27/choosing-a-machine-learning-classifier/) and others in [industry](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271616000265). The latter case is a review of Random Forests usage in remote sensing, where it has been employed to \"identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data\". It only makes sense to include this highly accurate model and test its performance. Some pros of this method is that it runs efficiently on large datasets, high feature dimensions, and even outputs a measure of importance of each feature, aka it performs some implicit feature selection (more advantages [here](https://medium.com/rants-on-machine-learning/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-random-forests-f33c3ce28883). A drawback is memory consumption: large forests might be hard to store and slow to evaluate. I believe this model is approrpiate because it seems to be effective on most ML tasks, and that we have high feature dimensions that might benefit from some feature tuning, so to speak."

    "Hello CharityML representative,\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that of the three models tested, I believe that the results show the \"linear support vector machine classifier\", aka `LinearSVC` above, is the most appropriate for the task. While on the surface all three algorithms performed roughly the same, we can see clear differences by examining the results closer. For example, we can immediately eliminate the `KNearestClassifier` as taking taking far too long to predict, not to mention coming in last for accuracy and f-score. Once we scale up the predictions to number in the millions, the code will take too long to predict the person in question's income. The other model, `RandomForest`, has similar scores and prediciton/training times as our chosen model. However, looking closer at the numbers, we can see that `LinearSVC` is slightly higher in accuracy and a full percentage point higher in its f-score (a measure of precision and recall, with more emphasis on precision in our case). Since we are interested in maximizing the efficency of our calls and therefore maximizing percentage of correctly predicted people who make >$50K--the precision of our calls--we should select the highest f-score which reflects this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus by process of elimination we selected `LinearSVC` from the three examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "An SVM classifier is suitable to a problem of this nature because it works well with the high number of features our data set has. While it might take slightly longer than a random forest to train (about 20% longer, but still fast relative to kNN), prediction times with the SVM are 10 times faster. Thus, as you scale the training and testing set to the millions, predicting a person's income should be relatively quick. \n",

    "**Answer: ** A support vector machine starts with the simple task of how to best separate the data into its two classes. In our case, we have 103 dimensions in which we want to draw a \"hyperplane\", or high-dimensional plane, that best divides the features of people between those who make >$50K and those who don't. An analog of this situation is, if you had a clear cube filled with red dots and blue dots, you would try to to cut the cube straight through into two pieces that would best maximize the amount of red on side and the amount of blue on the other. Since \"best\" is a bit subjective, in the case of the SVMs we mean we maximize the distance between the two differet classes, while still getting as many correct classifications on each side. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the data distrubtion doesn't lend itself to be \"linearly separable\"; in other words, you couldn't cut straight through the cube to split the dots.For example, all the red dots might be near the surface of the cube, while the blue might be on the interior. Fortunately, through the \"kernel trick\" of the SVM implementation, you can transform the data to a higher dimensional space, where the distances between dots are equivalent, and make a straight cut through the now separated data. This straight cut through the higher dimensional cube might look wobbly in the original, but it turns out to be the right separation. A picture is helpful in building intuition: \n",

These results are marginally better than the unoptimized model, with an increase of only 0.03% points in accuracy and .0018 points in F-score. Compared to the naive predictor benchmark, the optimized model will correctly predict potential donors 3.4x more frequently. This would be valuable to Charity ML. Furthermore, the F-score is 2.3x higher than the benchmark. Since this is our measure that is more sensitive to the measure of potentially successful calls (aka people actually making >$50K of those we call), this is quite a significant gain. "

Next I would put `occupation`, because your job usually determines your income. Next, `hours-per-week`, since usually full-time jobs make more than part-time, depending on your job (which is why I would rank it below `occupation`). Next, I would select `capital-gain` as an important feature, since I can't select a composite feature of `(capital-gain - capital-loss)`. I would assume those with more income would play the stock market or invest more, and those with capital gains would have higher income. Finally, I select `age` as the last important feature. I reason that the older you are, the longer you would be working, and hopefully the more you would make in your career.

    "**Answer:** Four of the five features I discussed appeared in the most relevant features, though none in the right order. I am surprised `occupation` isn't an important feature, since it seems to fix your income within a range. However, `capital-loss` and `capital-gain` being important confirms my intuition that the ability to have investment activity and also the result of that activity plays a heavy role in predicting income. Further, `age` being the second most important predictor shows that it has an even larger role in predicting income than I anticipated. My ego also appreciates `education-num` making an appearance since I ranked it first.   "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:** The final model's F-score and accuracy suffers using the top five features, but not overmuch. There is about a 5% reduction in the accuracy (loss of 4 percentage points to 80.29%) and a 16% reduction in F-score (loss of about 0.11 to 0.5740) from the model that uses all the features, while only gaining an 8% speedup of training time. While these are well above the minimum benchmarks (accuracy=0.2478, fscore=0.2917), I don't like sacrificing the accuracy and precision to save 5 minutes, supposing our original training time was an hour. Therefore, in this case, with my current choice of model, I would not use the reduced data as my training set. \n",
